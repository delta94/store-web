Qilin is an open-source digital distribution platform for game developers and publishers. Our mission is to distribute games by minimizing the effort of contracting, sharing documentation and providing comprehensive real-time statistics.

Our solution is part of Protocol One IAAS and is actively used in the Storefront constructor. Qilin can be used as a component in an existing P1-independent system, using its hardware or cloud platforms.
